## Reflection Questions 

1. One technical concept I developed greater mastery over during this project is deciding how to label things in html (id, class).

2. One project requirement that I found challenging at first was transitions and tranformation but getting them to work was really satisfiying and made me feel proud.

3. I didn't use AI as much as possible, favoring the use of mdn documents, giving me a greater understanding of the tech I wanted to use.

## AI Usage 

This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x64RXhfyTCkAln3pOg3KTzPlsc5AYP6x2jlcURZ1Uc0/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I used AI on this project.
